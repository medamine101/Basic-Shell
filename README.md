# Basic-Shell

Basic Linux Shell written in C.

Features:
- Some built in commands such as cd, jobs, fg, and bg
- Ability to execute many linux shell commands in the directories /usr/bin and /bin

Limitations:
- Cannot run more complex programs such as vim
- Programs that take user input such as grep take turns with the shell in taking user input when brought to the background and then returned to the foreground.
